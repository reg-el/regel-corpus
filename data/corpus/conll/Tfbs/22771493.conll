Direct	O
cooperation	O

We	O
have	O
studied	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
ATAD2	O
gene	O
expression	O
by	O
androgens	O
in	O
prostate	O

ATAD2	O
is	O
a	O
coactivator	O
of	O
the	O
androgen	O
receptor	O
(	O
AR	O
)	O
and	O
the	O
MYC	O
protein	O

We	O
showed	O
that	O
ATAD2	O
expression	O
is	O
directly	O

AR	O
via	O
an	O
AR	B-TFBS

the	I-TFBS
distal	I-TFBS

The	O

Using	O

we	O

From	O
the	O
analysis	O

we	O
conclude	O
that	O
this	O

results	O
from	O
