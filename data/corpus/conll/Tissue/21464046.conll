BACKGROUND	O
:	O
Recent	O
studies	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
hematopoietic	S-TISSUE
and	O
cardiac	B-TISSUE
lineages	E-TISSUE
have	O
close	O
ontogenic	O
origins	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
an	O
early	O
mesodermal	B-TISSUE
cell	E-TISSUE
population	O
has	O
the	O
potential	O
to	O
differentiate	O
into	O
both	O
lineages	O

Studies	O
also	O
suggest	O
that	O
specification	O
of	O
these	O
lineages	O
is	O
inversely	O

However	O

the	O
transcriptional	O

the	O

METHODS	O

Here	O

we	O
show	O
that	O
Nkx2	O

regulates	O
the	O
hematopoietic	O

fate	O
of	O

Using	O

we	O

We	O

that	O
