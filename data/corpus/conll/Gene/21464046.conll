BACKGROUND	O
:	O
Recent	O
studies	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
hematopoietic	O
and	O
cardiac	O
lineages	O
have	O
close	O
ontogenic	O
origins	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
an	O
early	O
mesodermal	O
cell	O
population	O
has	O
the	O
potential	O
to	O
differentiate	O
into	O
both	O
lineages	O
.	O


Studies	O
also	O
suggest	O
that	O
specification	O
of	O
these	O
lineages	O
is	O
inversely	O
regulated	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
transcriptional	O
networks	O
that	O
govern	O
the	O
cell	O
fate	O
specification	O

these	O

Here	O

We	O
