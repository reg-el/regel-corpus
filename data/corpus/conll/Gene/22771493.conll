Direct	O

androgen	B-GENE

We	O
have	O
studied	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
ATAD2	S-GENE
gene	O
expression	O
by	O
androgens	O
in	O
prostate	O
cells	O
.	O
ATAD2	S-GENE
is	O
a	O
coactivator	O
of	O
the	O
androgen	B-GENE
receptor	E-GENE
(	O
AR	S-GENE
)	O
and	O
the	O
MYC	S-GENE
protein	O

We	O
showed	O
that	O
ATAD2	S-GENE
expression	O
is	O
directly	O

by	O
AR	S-GENE
via	O
an	O
AR	S-GENE

sequence	O
(	O
ARBS	O

located	O
in	O
the	O

The	O

Using	O
knockdown	O

chromatin	O

we	O
could	O
demonstrate	O
that	O

From	O
the	O
analysis	O

we	O
conclude	O
that	O
this	O

results	O
from	O
a	O
chromatin	O
