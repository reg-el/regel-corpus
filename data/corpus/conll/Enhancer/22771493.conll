Direct	O
cooperation	O
between	O
androgen	O

reveals	O
a	O

regulation	O

for	O
androgen	O

genes	O
in	O

We	O
have	O
studied	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
ATAD2	O
gene	O
expression	O
by	O
androgens	O
in	O
prostate	O
cells	O
.	O


ATAD2	O
is	O
a	O
coactivator	O
of	O
the	O
androgen	O
receptor	O
(	O
AR	O
)	O
and	O
the	O
MYC	O
protein	O
.	O


We	O
showed	O
that	O
ATAD2	O
expression	O
is	O
directly	O
regulated	O
by	O
AR	O
via	O
an	O
AR	O
binding	O
sequence	O
(	O
ARBS	O
)	O
located	O
in	O
the	O
distal	B-ENHANCER
enhancer	E-ENHANCER
of	O
its	O
regulatory	O
region	O

The	O
gene	O
is	O
also	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
E2F1	O
transcription	O
factor	O

Using	O
knockdown	O

chromatin	O

technique	O
approaches	O

we	O
could	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
AR	O
and	O
E2F1	O
functionally	O
collaborate	O
and	O
physically	O
interact	O
between	O
each	O
other	O

From	O
the	O
analysis	O
of	O
chromatin	O
conformation	O
,	O
we	O
conclude	O
that	O
this	O
cooperation	O
results	O
from	O
a	O
chromatin	O
looping	O
over	O
the	O
ATAD2	O
promoter	O

Furthermore	O

we	O

that	O
several	O
