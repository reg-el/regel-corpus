Evolution	O

The	O
human	O
genome	O
contains	O
approximately	O
one	O
million	O
Alu	O
repetitive	O
elements	O
comprising	O
10	O
%	O
of	O
the	O
genome	O
,	O
yet	O
their	O
functions	O
are	O
not	O
well	O
understood	O
.	O


Here	O
,	O
we	O
show	O
that	O
Alu	O
elements	O
resemble	O
enhancers	O
.	O


Alu	O
elements	O
are	O
bound	O
by	O
two	O
well	O
-	O
phased	O
nucleosomes	O
that	O
contain	O
histones	O
bearing	O
marks	O
of	O
active	O
chromatin	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
show	O
tissue	O
-	O
specific	O
enrichment	O
for	O
the	O
enhancer	O
mark	O
H3K4me1	O
.	O


A	O
proportion	O
of	O
Alu	O
elements	O
were	O
experimentally	O
validated	O
as	O
bona	O
fide	O
active	O
enhancers	O
with	O
an	O
in	O
vitro	O
reporter	O
assay	O
.	O


In	O
addition	O
,	O
Hi	O
-	O
C	O
data	O
indicate	O
that	O
Alus	O
show	O
long	O
-	O
range	O
interactions	O
with	O
gene	O
promoters	O
.	O


We	O
also	O
find	O
that	O
Alus	O
are	O
generally	O
more	O
conserved	O
when	O
located	O
in	O
the	O
proximal	O
upstream	O
region	O
of	O
genes	O
.	O


Their	O
similarity	O
to	O
enhancers	O
becomes	O
more	O
prominent	O
with	O
their	O
age	O
in	O
the	O
human	O
genome	O
,	O
following	O
a	O
clear	O
evolutionary	O
continuum	O
reminiscent	O
of	O
the	O
evolutionary	O
pattern	O
of	O
proto	O
-	O
genes	O
.	O


Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
conclude	O
that	O
some	O
Alu	O
elements	O
can	O
function	O
as	O
enhancers	O
and	O
propose	O
that	O
many	O
more	O
may	O
be	O
proto	O
-	O
enhancers	O
that	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
repertoire	O
for	O
the	O
