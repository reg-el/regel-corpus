Enhancer invasion shapes MYCN-dependent transcriptional amplification in neuroblastoma. Amplification of the locus encoding the oncogenic transcription factor MYCN is a defining feature of high-risk neuroblastoma. Here we present the first dynamic chromatin and transcriptional landscape of MYCN perturbation in neuroblastoma. At oncogenic levels, MYCN associates with E-box binding motifs in an affinity-dependent manner, binding to strong canonical E-boxes at promoters and invading abundant weaker non-canonical E-boxes clustered at enhancers. Loss of MYCN leads to a global reduction in transcription, which is most pronounced at MYCN target genes with the greatest enhancer occupancy. These highly occupied MYCN target genes show tissue-specific expression and are linked to poor patient survival. The activity of genes with MYCN-occupied enhancers is dependent on the tissue-specific transcription factor TWIST1, which co-occupies enhancers with MYCN and is required for MYCN-dependent proliferation. These data implicate tissue-specific enhancers in defining often highly tumor-specific 'MYC target gene signatures' and identify disruption of the MYCN enhancer regulatory axis as a promising therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma.
