Condensin I and II Complexes License Full Estrogen Receptor alpha-Dependent Enhancer Activation. Enhancers instruct spatio-temporally specific gene expression in a manner tightly linked to higher-order chromatin architecture. Critical chromatin architectural regulators condensin I and condensin II play non-redundant roles controlling mitotic chromosomes. But the chromosomal locations of condensins and their functional roles in interphase are poorly understood. Here we report that both condensin complexes exhibit an unexpected, dramatic estrogen-induced recruitment to estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha)-bound eRNA(+) active enhancers in interphase breast cancer cells, exhibiting non-canonical interaction with ER-alpha via its DNA-binding domain (DBD). Condensins positively regulate ligand-dependent enhancer activation at least in part by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase, HECTD1, to modulate the binding of enhancer-associated coactivators/corepressors, including p300 and RIP140, permitting full eRNA transcription, formation of enhancer:promoter looping, and the resultant coding gene activation. Collectively, our results reveal an important, unanticipated transcriptional role of interphase condensins in modulating estrogen-regulated enhancer activation and coding gene transcriptional program.
