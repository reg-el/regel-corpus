The estrogen-regulated transcription factor PITX1 coordinates gene-specific regulation by estrogen receptor-alpha in breast cancer cells. The estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a master regulator of gene expression and works along with cooperating transcription factors in mediating the actions of the hormone estradiol (E2) in ER-positive tissues and breast tumors. Here, we report that expression of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor (PITX1), a tumor suppressor and member of the homeobox family of transcription factors, is robustly up-regulated by E2 in several ERalpha-positive breast cancer cell lines via ERalpha-dependent interaction between the proximal promoter and an enhancer region 5' upstream of the PITX1 gene. Overexpression of PITX1 selectively inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERalpha and ERbeta, while enhancing the activities of the glucocorticoid receptor and progesterone receptor. Reduction of PITX1 by small interfering RNA enhanced ERalpha-dependent transcriptional regulation of a subset of ERalpha target genes. The consensus PITX1 binding motif was found to be present in 28% of genome-wide ERalpha binding sites and was in close proximity to estrogen response elements in a subset of ERalpha binding sites, and E2 treatment enhanced PITX1 as well as ERalpha recruitment to these binding sites. These studies identify PITX1 as a new ERalpha transcriptional target that acts as a repressor to coordinate and fine tune target-specific, ERalpha-mediated transcriptional activity in human breast cancer cells.
