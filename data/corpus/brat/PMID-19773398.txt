X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by an inversion disrupting a conserved noncoding element upstream of the NR0B1 (DAX1) gene. CONTEXT: X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (AHCH) is known to be caused by coding mutations in the nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1 (NR0B1) gene, encoding the transcriptional repressor dosage-sensitive sex-reversal adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1 (DAX1). OBJECTIVE/PATIENTS: Four males in a family were affected by AHCH. Our aim was to locate the genetic cause of their disease, knowing that they had no mutation in the obvious candidate gene, NR0B1. DESIGN: Linkage analysis of the X chromosome and mutational screening of conserved noncoding regions upstream of NR0B1 were performed. To functionally characterize the genetic defect, studies of transcription and expression of DAX1 and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) were done. RESULTS: A 60 Mb inversion on the X chromosome with one of the inversion breakpoints located in a conserved noncoding region 4 kb upstream of NR0B1 was detected. The inversion causes relocation of a putative SF-1 binding site implicated in murine gonadal development. A reporter construct lacking this enhancer element upstream of NR0B1 was unresponsive to SF-1 transcriptional activation. Immunohistochemistry suggested that the inversion leads to SF-1 silencing in the patients' testes both in childhood and in adult life. CONCLUSION: We report a noncoding mutation causing AHCH, an inversion resulting in a phenotype similar to what is caused by intragenic NR0B1 null mutations. The inversion seems to disrupt and/or relocate regulatory sites crucial in DAX1 expression.
