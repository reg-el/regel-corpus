A new hypersensitive site, HS10, and the enhancers, E3' and Ed, differentially regulate Igkappa gene expression. The mouse Igkappa gene locus has three known transcriptional enhancers: an intronic enhancer (Ei), a 3' enhancer (E3'), and a further downstream enhancer (Ed). We previously discovered, using the chromosome conformation-capture technique, that Ei and E3' interact with a novel DNA sequence near the 3' end of the Igkappa locus, specifically in B cells. In the present investigation, we examined the function of this far downstream element. The sequence is evolutionarily conserved and exhibits a plasmacytoma cell-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site in chromatin, henceforth termed HS10 in the locus. HS10 acts as a coactivator of E3' in transient transfection assays. Although HS10(-/-) mice exhibited normal patterns of B cell development, they were tested further along with E3'(-/-) and Ed(-/-) mice for their Igkappa expression levels in plasma cells, as well as for both allelic and isotype exclusion in splenic B cells. HS10(-/-) and Ed(-/-), but not E3'(-/-), mice exhibited 2.5-fold lower levels of Igkappa expression in antigenically challenged plasma cells. E3'(-/-) mice, but not HS10(-/-) mice, exhibited impaired IgL isotype and allelic exclusion in splenic B cells. We have suggestive results that Ed may also weakly participate in these processes. In addition, HS10(-/-) mice no longer exhibited regional chromosome interactions with E3', and they exhibited modestly reduced somatic hypermutation in the Jkappa-Ckappa intronic region in germinal center B cells from Peyer's patches. We conclude that the HS10, E3', and Ed differentially regulate Igkappa gene dynamics.
