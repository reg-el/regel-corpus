The distal upstream region of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 enhances its expression in endometrial stromal cells during decidualization. We have previously shown that decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) causes a genome-wide increase in the levels of acetylation of histone-H3 Lys-27 (H3K27ac). We also reported that the distal gene regions, more than 3 kb up- or downstream of gene transcription start sites have increased H3K27ac levels. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is a specific decidualization marker and has increased H3K27ac levels in its distal upstream region (-4701 to -7501 bp). Here, using a luciferase reporter gene construct containing this IGFBP-1 upstream region, we tested the hypothesis that it is an IGFBP-1 enhancer. To induce decidualization, we incubated ESCs with cAMP and found that cAMP increased luciferase expression, indicating that decidualization increased the transcriptional activity from the IGFBP-1 upstream region. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of this region in HepG2 cells significantly reduced IGFBP-1 expression, confirming its role as an IGFBP-1 enhancer. A ChIP assay revealed that cAMP increased the recruitment of the transcriptional regulators CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), and p300 to the IGFBP-1 enhancer in ESCs. Of note, C/EBPbeta knockdown inhibited the stimulatory effects of cAMP on the levels of H3K27ac, chromatin opening, and p300 recruitment at the IGFBP-1 enhancer. These results indicate that the region -4701 to -7501 bp upstream of IGFBP-1 functions as an enhancer for IGFBP-1 expression in ESCs undergoing decidualization, that C/EBPbeta and FOXO1 bind to the enhancer region to up-regulate IGFBP-1 expression, and that C/EBPbeta induces H3K27ac by recruiting p300 to the IGFBP-1 enhancer.
