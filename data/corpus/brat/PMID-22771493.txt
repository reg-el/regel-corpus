Direct cooperation between androgen receptor and E2F1 reveals a common regulation mechanism for androgen-responsive genes in prostate cells. We have studied the regulation of ATAD2 gene expression by androgens in prostate cells. ATAD2 is a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) and the MYC protein. We showed that ATAD2 expression is directly regulated by AR via an AR binding sequence (ARBS) located in the distal enhancer of its regulatory region. The gene is also regulated by the E2F1 transcription factor. Using knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique approaches, we could demonstrate that AR and E2F1 functionally collaborate and physically interact between each other. From the analysis of chromatin conformation, we conclude that this cooperation results from a chromatin looping over the ATAD2 promoter region between the ARBS and E2F1 binding site in an androgen-dependent manner. Furthermore, we could show that several genes overexpressed in prostate cancer and potentially involved in several aspects of tumor development have an ARBS and an E2F1 binding site in their regulatory regions and exhibit the same mechanism of regulation by both transcription factors as ATAD2.
