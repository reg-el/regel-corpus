Identification of a novel putative mitochondrial protein FAM210B associated with erythroid differentiation. The transcription factor GATA-1 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. To identify novel GATA-1 target genes, we analyzed a merged ChIP-seq and expression profiling dataset. We identified FAM210B as a putative novel GATA-1 target gene. Study results demonstrated that GATA-1 directly regulates FAM210B expression, presumably by binding to an intronic enhancer region. Both human and murine FAM210B are abundantly expressed in the later stages of erythroblast development. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence predicted that FAM210B is a membrane protein, and Western blot analysis demonstrated its mitochondrial localization. Loss-of-function analysis in erythroid cells suggested that FAM210B may be involved in erythroid differentiation. The identification and characterization of FAM210B provides new insights in the study of erythropoiesis and hereditary anemias.
