Putting cryptogenic stroke into perspective. In patients who have a cryptogenic stroke and have their PFO closed, the recurrence rate of "cerebral ischemia" is much greater in patients who are older than 55 years. Most of these recurrent events (2 strokes and 4TIAs) in the older age group were due to identifiable causes. These findings corroborate the long-term results from the RESPECT randomized clinical trial of PFO closure versus medical therapy.
