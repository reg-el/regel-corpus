c-Maf activates the promoter and enhancer of the IL-21 gene, and TGF-beta inhibits c-Maf-induced IL-21 production in CD4+ T cells. Previous studies have shown that IL-6 potently induces IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells, whereas TGF-beta inhibits IL-6-induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells. We found that IL-6 induced c-Maf expression in CD4(+) T cells and that the enforced expression of c-Maf induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells without IL-6, IL-4/STAT6 signaling, or an autocrine effect of IL-21. Moreover, we found that c-Maf directly bound to and activated IL-21P and the CNS-2 enhancer through MARE sites. On the other hand, we also found that although TGF-beta up-regulated IL-6-induced c-Maf expression in CD4(+) T cells, TGF-beta inhibited c-Maf-induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells. Finally, we found that Foxp3 bound to IL-21P and the CNS-2 enhancer and inhibited c-Maf-induced IL-21 production modestly but significantly in CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that c-Maf induces IL-21 production directly in CD4(+) T cells by activating IL-21P and the CNS-2 enhancer and that TGF-beta suppresses c-Maf-induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells.
