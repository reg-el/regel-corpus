The DEK Oncoprotein Is a Critical Component of the EKLF/KLF1 Enhancer in Erythroid Cells. Understanding how transcriptional regulators are themselves controlled is important in attaining a complete picture of the intracellular effects that follow signaling cascades during early development and cell-restricted differentiation. We have addressed this issue by focusing on the regulation of EKLF/KLF1, a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a necessary role in the global regulation of erythroid gene expression. Using biochemical affinity purification, we have identified the DEK oncoprotein as a critical factor that interacts with an essential upstream enhancer element of the EKLF promoter and exerts a positive effect on EKLF levels. This element also binds a core set of erythroid transcription factors, suggesting that DEK is part of a tissue-restricted enhanceosome that contains BMP4-dependent and -independent components. Together with local enrichment of properly coded histones and an open chromatin domain, optimal transcriptional activation of the EKLF locus can be established.
